# Portfolio

The work I have done professionally is, unfortunately, need-to-know only as it was written for the US Navy and US Marine Corps. Because I am a person quick to offer help and guidance, my friends often depend on me to help them with resumes, cover letters, and crucial school work. Thus, the majority of the documentation you'll find here has been done for others. 

The original work you'll find in this folder was written for Jack Rhysider as either a writing test or the full video script. Because YouTube is an informal medium, Jack asked me to write his script in an unconventional format so he could read it on the page without the typical script formatting.
