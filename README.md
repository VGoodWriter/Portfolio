Writing, editing, and coding done outside work hours.

In the last five years I have spent a significant amount of time learning new skills. This means learning to code a little bit in C, and using those skills to learn how to read any other programming language required for my positions. You'll find those small programs in this folder as well as many items I've edited and created for friends. Working for the government means a lot of my documentation is proprietary and need-to-know only, so I am unable to share those items outside the teams I worked for.
